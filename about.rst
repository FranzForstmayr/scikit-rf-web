History
~~~~~~~~

**scikit-rf** was born in the `University of Virginia's <http://www.virginia.edu>`_ millimeter wave research lab in 2009, to provide functionality that was not available commercially. It was originally called mwavepy, but was re-branded a `scikit <http://www.scikits.appspot.com/>`_ to emphasize its relationship to the scientific python community. 

It is currently being developed by a group of volunteers  `on Github <https://github.com/scikit-rf/scikit-rf/graphs/contributors>`_ .
