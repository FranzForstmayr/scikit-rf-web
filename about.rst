**scikit-rf** was born in the `University of Virginia's <http://www.virginia.edu>`_ millimeter wave research lab in 2009, to provide functionality that was not available commercially. It was originally called mwavepy, but was re-branded a `scikit <http://www.scikits.appspot.com/>`_ to emphasize its relationship to the scientific python community.  **scikit-rf** is licensed under the :doc:`BSD License <license>` and is currently being developed by a group of volunteers  `on Github <https://github.com/scikit-rf/scikit-rf/graphs/contributors>`_ . 

Motivation 
~~~~~~~~~~~

As computer software continues to play an increasing role in the field of engineering design and analysis, it’s architecture becomes more important. To a degree, it is
the software’s design that determines which solutions are chosen. The more refined
and specialized the tool, the more pronounced it’s effect becomes. This can create a problem for research-type environments, which constantly require new and
innovative solutions. **scikit-rf** was consciously designed to provide essential functionality without imposing arbitrary limits or restrictions on its users.

DMPI designs, manufactures and sells millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelength on-wafer ground-signal-ground probes and associated components for electrical measurement of devices and materials. We have developed a scalable approach for the manufacturing of phsyically robust micro machined probes with low-insertion loss coupling to the DUT and DC biasing of probed circuits.
