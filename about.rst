Development History

**scikit-rf** was born in the `University of Virginia's <http://www.virginia.edu>`_ millimeter wave research lab in 2009, to provide functionality that was not available commercially. It was originally called mwavepy, but was re-branded a `scikit <http://www.scikits.appspot.com/>`_ to emphasize its relationship to the scientific python community.  **scikit-rf** is licensed under the :doc:`BSD License <license>` and is currently being actively developed by a group of volunteers  `on Github <https://github.com/scikit-rf/scikit-rf/graphs/contributors>`_ . 

Motivation 
~~~~~~~~~~~

As computer software continues to play an increasing role in the field of engineering design and analysis, it’s architecture becomes more important. To a degree, it is
the software’s design that determines which solutions are chosen. The more refined
and specialized the tool, the more pronounced it’s effect becomes. This can create a problem for research-type environments, which constantly require new and
innovative solutions. **scikit-rf** was consciously designed to provide essential functionality without imposing arbitrary limits or restrictions on its users.

Acknowledging or Citing scikit-rf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Publications
++++++++++++++++

If you use scikit-rf for work/research presented in a publication (whether directly, or as a dependency to another package), we ask that you ackowledge it. Perhaps with something like:

*This research made use of scikit-rf, an open-source Python package for RF and Microwave applications.*

You can also include a link to www.scikit-rf.org (if the journal allows this) in addition to the above text.

In Presentations or Apps
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you are giving a presentation featuring work/research that makes use of scikit-rf or creating an app that  uses sciki-rf under the hood, we provide this *powered by* image, 
( :download:`PNG <_static/powered_by_scikit-rf.png>` | :download:`SVG <_static/powered_by_scikit-rf.svg>` ).
