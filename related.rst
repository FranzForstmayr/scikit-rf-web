HFTools 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://github.com/hftools/hftools

Hftools is a python package containing useful tools for high frequency electrical engineering problems. Hftools is focused on generally useful tools such as file readers, multiport classes, an improved array class (hfarray), dataset class. More specialized tools will be broken out into seprate packages. One such package is caltools which contains tools for doing Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) calibrations.ort** tries to provide an intuitive interface to n-port network parameters. The frequency dependence of the parameters is handled transparantly so that the user does not have to take care of this manually. This way, performing calculations on n-port data is simplified significantly. In addition, a number of functions are provided to manipulate the n-port data, such as converting between different n-port representations.


Python IVI
~~~~~~~~~~

http://github.com/alexforencich/python-ivi

Python IVI is a Python-based interpretation of the Interchangeable Virtual Instrument standard from the IVI foundation. Python IVI can use Python VXI-11, Python USBTMC, pySerial and linux-gpib to connect to instruments. The implementation of the initialize method takes a VISA resource string and attempts to connect to an instrument. 


QUCS
~~~~~~~

http://qucs.sourceforge.net/

**Qucs** is an integrated circuit simulator which means you are able to setup a circuit with a graphical user interface (GUI) and simulate the large-signal, small-signal and noise behaviour of the circuit. After that simulation has finished you can view the simulation results on a presentation page or window.

hycohanz
~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

http://mradway.github.io/hycohanz/

**hycohanz** is an Open Source (BSD license) Python wrapper interface to the ANSYS HFSS Windows COM API, enabling you to control HFSS from Python. hycohanz simplifies control of HFSS from Python for RF, microwave, and antenna engineers.
